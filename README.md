# Linear-ETC-CLARITY-Chamber
An inexpensive, simple, and robust tissue clearing chamber for the CLARITY method.

The Optogenetics and Neural Engineering (ONE) Core of the University of Colorado has designed a new ETC chamber made mostly from ‘off the shelf’ plumbing parts. Compared to other chamber designs, this design is easy to fabricate, is less prone to leaking, is easily expandable, better secures the tissue, deals well with bubbles, and is inexpensive (less than $65/chamber). The clearing solution flows in the same direction as the current, and is therefore called Linear ETC. This leads to efficient clearing (half mouse brain in two days). More information can be found in the .pdf posted to dropbox below (no account necessary).

### Introduction
Clear Lipid-exchanged Acrylamide-hybridized Rigid Imaging / Immunostaining / in situ-hybridization-compatible Tissue hYdrogel (CLARITY) as developed by Chung et al., 2013, is a method to affix a biological tissue sample in a hydrogel polymer and rapidly clear tissue of light scattering molecules. Large molecules such as proteins are mostly unaffected by the clearing process, therefore allowing for deep tissue imaging. CLARITY requires a Electrophoretic Tissue Clearing (ETC) chamber for holding the tissue as a Clearing Solution passes around the tissue and electricity applies force to the charged miscues, thereby speeding up the clearing process. Current chamber designs (http://forum.claritytechniques.org/) are suggested to either be bought as a unit from a supplier, 3D Printed, or fabricated through custom means. As reported in the CLARITY forum, these chambers are expensive, require expert tooling (3D Printers), frequently leak, are prone to variability, and can be difficult to expand. The methods suggested to secure the tissue within the electric field are variable and tissue-electrode contact has frequently been reported. Custom fabrication is prone to air leaks into the system and the electrode-solution interface may also introduce bubbles in the electric field. This can lead to uneven clearing or will over time build up and decrease the applied current.
